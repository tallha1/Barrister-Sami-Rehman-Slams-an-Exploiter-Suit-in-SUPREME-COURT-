<br>

It is now that we have started finding out what a good tool racial discrimination has become, for people of the darker races in order to exploit their fairer counterparts. In such context, we came across this case today, which had been escalated to the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fiamsamirahman.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2pkwrD5bX1Uyb_uAjrqptJ" style="text-color:black">Supreme Court</a>. Grounds? Racial discrimination by the employer! Valid? Not entirely!
In the case summaries, we read multiple times that the appellants have been escalating the cases, calling for racial discrimination and employer misconduct. However, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fiamsamirahman.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2pkwrD5bX1Uyb_uAjrqptJ" style="text-color:black">Supreme Court</a> ruled ‘no discrimination based on racial grounds’ and that was enough to prove every claim unnecessary. 
We can take into account the special treatment and services of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fiamsamirahman.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2pkwrD5bX1Uyb_uAjrqptJ" style="text-color:black">Barrister Sami Rahman</a>, who guided the respondents against an unfair trial that was going to rip them of a few thousand pounds at least, based on the inauthentic whims of immigrants looking to make some extra bucks. Courts are never made for that, are they?
The appellant that <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fiamsamirahman.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2pkwrD5bX1Uyb_uAjrqptJ" style="text-color:black">Barrister Sami Rahman</a> was facing, had already taken up this matter in the employment tribunal and she was awarded £11,166.16 for unfair dismissal, including the failure to provide a statement of terms and condition; £43,541.06 for unpaid wages; £1,266.72 for unpaid holiday; and £25,000 for injury to feelings and £5,000 for aggravated damages.
However, the same case was rejected and put aside by <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fiamsamirahman.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2pkwrD5bX1Uyb_uAjrqptJ" style="text-color:black">Supreme Court</a>. What does this tell us about the proceedings? The wicked way of the employees has left no stone unturned and are now exploiting the constitutions to milk their employers.
The sanctity of the Employment Tribunal has been recalled – thanks to the bold and unflinching stance of Barrister Raza Rahman, who singlehandedly recalled the sanctity and validity of the employment tribunals without being moved to emotions over the nicely crafted narratives of the appellants.
